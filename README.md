> This project was fully designed and solved by me.  
As a **challenge** to me I have decided not to use other resources than my brain.

## What I have done 🎆
* figured out how algorithm should work + detected and solved recursive loops
* figured out how to create intuitive interactive board
    * grid manipulation
    * drawing (pressing, holding, right-click as delete button)
* UI & UX

## What I have improved 💪🏼
* divided code into modules - cleaner js
* ES6 - classes instead of objects
* used scss instead of css - cleaner css
* debugging - I love recursive functions :))

## What should be improved 🙄
* `fixed` ~~rare bugs in displaying path~~
* ~~Mobile RWD - I have focused on PC, maybe designing it for mobiles will be my future challange~~

## Future tasks 🏆
* code refactor
* `completed` ~~optimization - I came up with an idea that algorithm can skip some paths comparing it's length to length of the path from the other side of a junction. I do not know yet how to implement it.~~
* `completed` ~~scroll to change fill-mode and info about right click shortcut~~
